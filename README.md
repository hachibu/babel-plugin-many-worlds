# Many Worlds JavaScript Interpreter

According to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics our world is
constantly branching off into new worlds with slight differences. This means
that our programs are also branching. This program allows you to explore
mistakes you might have made in another timeline. I should warn you that using
this program may lead to quantum branching of your world.

Here's a list of things this program may or may not change:

- Shuffle or empty arrays.
- Swap binary expression operands.
- Shuffle function call arguments.
- Create off-by-one errors.
- Create typos.

## Usage

    bin/run examples/add.js
